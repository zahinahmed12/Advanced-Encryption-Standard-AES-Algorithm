# Advanced-Encryption-Standard-AES-Algorithm
Implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit key

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a popular and widely adopted symmetric key encryption algorithm.
This program can encrypt and decrypt not only text but also other objects (e.g., pdf, image etc.).
Also, we've generated the S-Box and the Inverse S-Box tables instead of using hardcoded values.
